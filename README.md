# mp-lib

A small C library (mostly for education purposes)

## [containers](https://github.com/selym3/mp-lib/tree/main/containers)

* Each header is a container data struct
* The headers are not really supposed to be used together, as type definitions (that make the code more readable) will repeat
* In more realistic implementations, core many data structures will be defined in terms of core data structures (e.g. vector and deque)

## [tests](https://github.com/selym3/mp-lib/tree/main/tests)

* Each program shows how tasks might be accomplished with the data structures
* Note: the programs are also tests so they might work with an old version of the data structure
